# Race Line Optimization
# Generate Waypoints / Raceline (Offline with LINUX Computer)

These need to be generated on a Linux computer. You can just use VSCode and remote SSH from your Macbook.

## Option 1: Generate using Raceline Optimization

This is the preferred pipeline. SSH into the remote computer from VSCode. Then,

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/Raceline-Optimization
conda activate raceline
```

Run map_converter.ipynb, changing MAP_NAME to the name of the map. Make sure to look at the waypoints and see if everything is generated properly.

Run sanity_check.ipynb to make sure everything works.

Change inside main_globaltrac_f110.py the MAP_NAME to the name of the map.

```sh
python3 main_globaltraj_f110.py
```
The waypoints should be generated in 'outputs/<MAP_NAME>'.

### Common Errors
You might get a “At least two spline normals are crossed”. In this case, just reduce the number of points generated in map_converter.ipynb (e.g., take half of the points).

Sometimes, the solver can seem to get stuck for a long time. In this case, go into f110.ini, and play around with increasing the numbers below:

```sh
stepsize_opts={"stepsize_prep": 0.5,
               "stepsize_reg": 1.5,
               "stepsize_interp_after_opt": 1}
```
To get a good safety margin, add the following:
```sh
optim_opts_mintime={"width_opt": 0.6}
```
However, if you make this value too large, the solver will run into an error.

You can run visualize_raceline.ipynb to sanity check the raceline generated.

Once you are happy with the raceline generated, right-click the file and download it locally, onto the F1TENTH pure_pursuit/racelines.

You should also push on the RRT node in case you want to do dynamic obstacle avoidance:
```sh
cp ~/Desktop/Raceline-Optimization/outputs/<MAP_NAME>/<OUTPUT_NAME>.csv ~/Desktop/f1tenth_ws/src/rrt/racelines
```
Push those changes. Now, from your Macbook, pull these changes, so then in the next step you scp the nodes onto the F1TENTH.

## Option 2: Generate using the Waypoint Logger in Simulation
Use the waypoint generator node to manually create waypoints:
```sh
ros2 run waypoint_generator waypoint_subscriber
```
