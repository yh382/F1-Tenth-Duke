[3.573s]   By not providing "Findament_lint_auto.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[3.573s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[3.573s]   "ament_lint_auto", but CMake did not find one.
[3.573s] 
[3.573s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ament_lint_auto"
[3.573s]   with any of the following names:

[3.573s] 
[3.573s]   Add the installation prefix of "ament_lint_auto" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[3.573s]   set "ament_lint_auto_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
[3.573s]   If "ament_lint_auto" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
[3.573s]   sure it has been installed.
