CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:31 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinterfaces_hot_wheels.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "interfaces_hot_wheels", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "interfaces_hot_wheels" with any of the following names:

    interfaces_hot_wheelsConfig.cmake
    interfaces_hot_wheels-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "interfaces_hot_wheels" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "interfaces_hot_wheels_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "interfaces_hot_wheels" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
